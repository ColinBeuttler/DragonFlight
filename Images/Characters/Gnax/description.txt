Berdi leads you thorugh the city until you come to a large stalagmite with windows carved into its sides.
        
She leads you up the spiral staircase carved into the rock until you arrive at a giant stainglass doorway.
        
The two of you enter the stalagmite into a room with a fireplace and giant stone columns reachign to the ceiling, all the furnitrue is covered in furs.
        
you are led up another staircase within the structure, until you find yourself standing in front of a small stone door.
        
You both walk through the door, you are standing within an office, bookshelves on either side of you, a large rug covering the stone floor.
        
'Excuse the mess, I was expecting company,' a raspy voice says as a tall pale goblin stands up from behind a large wooden desk.
        
His eyes are dark and widely spaced on a slim, angular face. His ears are long, broad at the base and end in sharp points, resembling those of a bat's.
        
Both of his giant ears are pierced multiple times along the bottom edge, his flat triangular nose had a large gold ring through the center.
        
'My name is Gnax, I'm the elder of the cave Goblin Dragon Tribe. And you have already met Berdi...' He turns to Berdi and smiles.
        
'So let's get started you have a lot of work ahead of you, first you will need to get a riding suit, and I doubt we have a spare suit that would fit a human.'
