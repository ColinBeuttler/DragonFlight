The room before you seems to be a lounge of some kind, the walls are white and totally smooth.

There is a bar on one side of the room and a sunken conversation area with red seating all the way around, 

soft light is coming from the walls and windows stretching along the wall opposite to you.

Gilly leads you through another door and then a hallway and then yet another hallway until you come to what appears to be a manager's back office.

You setp inside, to find a small room separated by a large colored glass panel, on one side is a small but very tidy bed,

on the other, there is a single glass table with three benches, one on each side except the side adjecnt the only window in the room.

The walls are grey and featureless, sitting at the bench agaisnt the glass wall is a tall figure smoking a cigarette.
        
As you enter, the figure turns her head, she has a narrow elven face with pale green skin, a visor covers the top half of her face.
        
Her eyes glowing through the transparent visor, resembling two pink embers, a horn sticking out of the helmet on either side of her head.
        
She grins as you enter, as she does her purple lips grip her cigarette tighter exposing her pointed canines.
        
'Welcome, come please sit down here' her voice travels across the room with a smooth effortlessness.
        
As you walk over and sit down you notice she is wearing a form fitting black flight suit with a cut-off fur linned jacket on top.
        
'I'm Xopa, chief commander of the Xeno Tribe, I like to personally meet new riders to help them take their first steps...'
        
'So first steps... you're gonna need a flight suit like mine, that withstand the intensity of a wormhole...'
